# 🚨 Copilot/AI Automation Resume Instructions

**Purpose:**
This file is a quick-start guide for resuming Copilot or AI agent automation if credits expire, the agent is interrupted, or you need to re-initialize automation. It is for EMERGENCY/RECOVERY use only and does NOT override your main documentation or process files.

---

## 1. **What To Do If Copilot/AI Stops Working**

- **Check your Copilot/AI credits** (renew if needed)
- **Reopen VS Code** and reload the workspace
- **Open this file** (`COPILOT_RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) in the marketplace subfolder
- **Prompt Copilot/AI:**
  > "@workspace Read COPILOT_RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md and resume from last known state."
- **If you have a handoff file:**
  > "Also read COPILOT_HANDOFF.md for full project context."

---

## 2. **Where to Find Project Context**

- **Main process, roadmap, and technical docs:**
  - `PROJECT_SYNC.md` (roadmap, priorities)
  - `COPILOT_HANDOFF.md` (full session context)
  - `MARKETPLACE_REDESIGN_PLAN.md` (UX/UI)
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (AI agent onboarding)
- **Parent site analysis:**
  - `PARENT_SITE_ANALYSIS.md`

---

## 3. **How to Resume Safely**

- **Do NOT overwrite or delete any main documentation files.**
- **Always back up before major changes.**
- **Follow the instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for adding new features.**
- **If unsure, ask for confirmation before making structural changes.**

---

## 4. **If All Else Fails**

- **Restore from backup** (see `BACKUP_INVENTORY.md` or backup folders)
- **Check GitHub Issues** for automated tracking and recovery suggestions
- **Contact a project maintainer** for manual intervention

---

## 5. **For AI Agents**

- Always read all context files above before acting
- Never supersede or overwrite main documentation
- Document all changes in a new file if unsure
- When in doubt, ask the user for explicit instructions

---

**This file is for emergency/manual resumption only. For normal operations, always follow the main documentation and process files.**
