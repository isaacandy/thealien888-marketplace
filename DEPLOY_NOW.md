## 🚀 YOUR NEXT STEPS (IN ORDER)

### STEP 1: Ensure Git is Up to Date (5 minutes)
```bash
cd c:\Users\DrIsaacAndyPhD\OneDrive\ -\ iZND\ Services\workspace\thealien888-marketplace
# Ensure your local branch is up-to-date with your remote repository
# Check current status
git status

# If you see uncommitted changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Netlify deployment"

# Push to GitHub/GitLab
git push origin main
```

### STEP 2: Go to Netlify Dashboard (2 minutes)
```
URL: https://app.netlify.com/
```

1. **Log in** to your Netlify account
   - If you don't have one, create a free account

2. **Click "New site from Git"**
   - Appears as large button in dashboard

### STEP 3: Connect Your Repository (3 minutes)

1. **Choose your Git provider**
   - GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket

2. **Select your repository**
   - Look for: `thealien888-marketplace` or parent repo
   - If using parent repo, Netlify will build the subfolder

3. **Review build settings**
   - Netlify should auto-detect from `netlify.toml`:
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `.next`
     - Node version: 22

### STEP 4: Add Environment Variables (2 minutes)

1. **Click "Deploy site"** (Netlify might warn about missing env vars - that's OK)

2. **Once deployment starts, go to Site Settings**
   - Click: **Site Settings** (top menu)
   - Go to: **Environment Variables**

3. **Add the two required variables:**
   ```
   Name: RARIBLE_API_KEY
   Value: [REDACTED]
   
   Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_RARIBLE_API_KEY
   Value: [REDACTED]
   ```

4. **Save and trigger redeploy**
   - Click: **Redeploy site** in Deploys tab

### STEP 5: Monitor First Deployment (5 minutes)

1. **Go to Deploys tab**
   - Watch the build progress
   - Should take 2-5 minutes

2. **Check for any errors**
   - View build logs if deployment fails
   - Common issues in NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md

### STEP 6: Verify Deployment (5 minutes)

1. **Site goes live**
   - Netlify assigns temporary URL (e.g., `https://thealien888-marketplace-xyz.netlify.app`)
   - Shows in Deploys tab

2. **Click site URL to visit**
   - Gallery should load
   - No errors in browser console
   - Images load properly

3. **Test key features**
   - ✅ Gallery loads NFTs
   - ✅ Can switch between tabs
   - ✅ RainbowKit wallet button appears
   - ✅ Subdomain claim page accessible
   - ✅ No 404 errors
