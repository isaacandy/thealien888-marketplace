## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT

1. **Let Netlify Handle the Build**
   - Don't pre-build locally; let Netlify use `netlify.toml`
   - Ensures consistent build environment

2. **Monitor First Deploy**
   - Build might take 3-5 minutes first time
   - Subsequent builds will be faster (with caching)

3. **Check Build Logs**
   - If deployment fails, check Netlify build logs immediately
   - Common issues section in deployment guide covers 90% of problems

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Double-check keys are copied correctly
   - No extra spaces or quotes

5. **Domain Configuration**
   - After deployment, consider connecting custom domain
   - Enable automatic HTTPS (Netlify default)
